This repo contains various small projects that I wanted to keep, but I do not feel warrant their own repo.

dg_keygen - An AutoIt script that automates a keygenerator. Includes a command line app and a web interface.

xbmc-send - I use uTorrent and XBMC. This script lets uTorrent send messages to my XBMC box so I can see when torrents
start and finish. It cleans up the names and does some light file renaming too.

remove_black.php - Recusively look through a directory finding and deleting any images that are mostly black.
