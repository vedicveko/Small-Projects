shadowa4: 29 y/o female. Knows everyone in the E.D. by first name (including me) given she spends a fair amount of time with us. Well known for having osteogenesis imperfecta, this patient comes to the E.D. every time she has even a minor fall or contusion (which is *often*). This is just one of the *many* pelvis films I've done on her. I've been x-raying her since she was 25.<br>
tehgearz: At first I thought it was a valus/vargus deformity. Gotta love the repeat customers. We had a NICU infant on ECMO that I must have done a portable on ever day for a month; poor thing.<br>

<b>TheBozo:</b> This is a Nuclear Medicine exam.  They inject you with a radionuclide that has some type of "sugar" added to it.  This Tracer helps the radioactive material to be absorbed where the body is working the most.  For example, if you have a small fracture in your foot then your body will be working to heal the area and will absorb that sugar+radionuclide.  The hot spot seems to be more in your ankle than metatarsals.  I am only a radiographer and have an extremely limited knowledge base of nuclear medicine; and even less knowledge to be able to diagnose anything from the images that you have supplied.  Are you not able to obtain the dictated report from the radiologist who read these scans? <br><br>

<b>boredandawake:</b> This is a fantastic explanation of how a PET scan works, but is a little misguided for a bone scan. There are tons of non sugar-based substances attached to the radioactive tracers used, tailored to each exam in nuclear medicine. In a bone scan, for example, it's MDP (methylene diphosphonate), not a sugar. The phosphate interacts with bone, specifically, and doesn't necessarily have to do with how much energy is being used. 

But all that being said, I still think your description of how nuclear medicine works in general is a good one. <br>

Diagnosis inside. -> <a href="http://imgur.com/cKlLv"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cKlLv.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt="" /></a><br><br>

<b>Prawns3:</b> Symmetrical muscle uptake involving shoulder and pelvis girdles, along with paraspinal musculature. Intense uptake throughout right innominate bone of the pelvis, with mild patchy uptake within rest of pelvic bone. When correlated with previous CT imaging, the expansion and cortical bone thickening is highly suggestive of Paget’s. Sclerotic foci identified through CT study showed no increased tracer uptake.

After a bit of research I discovered this patient has Rhabdomyolysis. Patient had extremely high-cholesterol and was prescribed statins to manage it. Apparently a extremely unlikely side-effect of statin use is that it completely wrecks the muscles. Bone scans, funnily enough, are meant to show bones with soft-tissue uptake seldom seen. During rhabdo the muscle-injury disrupts the calcium-phosphate balance, resulting in increased uptake of HDP. I'd say inflammation also plays a part in the appearance with more blood flow to these areas. <br><br>

<b>analgesiac:</b> Very cool. With all that muscle activity I was thinking along the lines of polymyositis or other connective tissue disorder. Have not seen a case of rhabdo on a bone scan before.<br>

<b>mekneehurts:</b> Some more info about myself, is I am a healthy 25 year old male.  Injury occurred from running/athletic overuse and not trauma.  Pain and stiffness radiating from knee cap, down and above area with swelling in the region.<br><br>

<b>FlyingHaxor:</b> The slices you provided don't show anything abnormal, but it's impossible to come to any type of conclusions without more images.

Having said that, based on your age and history, your diagnosis is most likely patellofemoral syndrome. The first line of treatment is physical therapy for quad strengthening/patellar stabilization exercises, anti-inflammatories, and icing. If your physical exam was consistent with patellofemoral syndrome, I would have begin treatment prior to obtaining an MRI. MRI would be reserved for cases where treatment failed.<br>

<b>pintastico:</b> As far as I know this technique has not been used in practice elsewhere, but please correct me if I'm wrong (I can't find any literature on it).

We had a referral from the gynaecologists about a woman who had an IUD, but now wanted it removed so as to try for a pregnancy. On direct examination they could not find the 'strings' to remove it. Normally they would perform hysteroscopy to remove it, but the patient refused and asked if there was any other way.

After multi-disciplinary discussion I offered to try using an endovascular-snare (usually used for retrieving wires or filters from veins/arteries). A speculum was placed in the introitus and the cervical os was cannulated with a 6Fr guide catheter. The snare was passed through the catheter and manipulated until it caught the tip of the IUD. Gentle traction was applied and the IUD removed in it's entirety. No analgesia or theatre time required.
<br><br>

<b>NpStudent0005:</b> I know in China and other parts of Asia they use ring IUDs which do not have strings.  I'm not sure what the removal process is, but there must be a standard.  <br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> The *whoops* post yesterday by [Yellowbenzene](http://www.reddit.com/user/Yellowbenzene) made me remember this unfortunate occurrence at my facility. *No* I did not scan this patient, but needless to say it cost the technologist her job. I wish I could say this was the result of a persistent physician wanting a scan no matter the consequences, but sadly its not. This 35 y/o female was scanned simply by mistake. The technologist took the wrong patient, and performed a CT Abd/Pelvis. The patient had no idea what was going on and didn’t utter a word of questioning or doubt.



Details such as the gestational age are unknown to me, but the last bit of info I had was of a medical physicist coming in to acquire dose exposure calculations for the case. This, for lack of a better word *just sucks*

<br><br>

<b>Cindy_Lou_Who:</b> I almost had something similar happen to me (getting the wrong patient).  

I went out to the waiting room and called the patient's name "Jane".  A woman jumped up and almost ran me down to get through the door.  

Patient:  "Hurry up!  Let's get this over with!"

Me:  "How do you pronounce your last name?"

Patient:  "C'mon!  I really have to pee!"

Me:  "Ma'am, are you getting an ultrasound today?"

Patient:  "Yes!  Let's go!"

Me:  "I'm a mammographer.  I called for Jane Doe.  Is that your name?"

Patient:  "No.  My name is Hildegard Peabody! Now do my test!"

The patient's brilliant scheme was to answer to the next name called and just take their slot.  I don't know if it occurred to her that not everybody in the waiting room was getting a pelvic ultrasound.<br>

20121029 15:44:51 - Wordpressing: Image quality issue? -> <a href="http://imgur.com/mXgPg">Check out the full album of images</a><br><br><br>

<b>etrtr:</b> This image was taken with the large focal spot selected by mistake. Technique was 70 kv at 10 mAs. The MA was set to 640 and the seconds to .016. The image was repeated on the small focal spot, and came out perfectly, but the seconds were at .064. I'm under the impression that the large focal spot, though not ideal for knees, should still produce a diagnostic image. Could this possibly be a problem with the large focal spot? Or is the time and Ma possibly responsible? The system is a Kodak Carestream CR system.<br><br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> If you're referring to the *grainy* quality of the image then I would consider the following:

Yes, the large focal spot should still produce a diagnostic, although not completely optimal, image for knees. However, by the numbers you've given out here it seems that the mAs for those two exposures were completely different. You said the milliseconds changed from 16 to 64. That changes the mAs from 10 to 40 if your mA remained unchanged.

Ideally you would want the small focal spot whenever possible for knees. The large one will work as well, just mind the exposure settings because you'll probably need more elevated factors. The larger spot will naturally require more mAs given the larger field of coverage (photons are dispersed over a larger area, and therefore can create an image like the one you posted).

Lastly, using the large FS when you needed the small one is and admissible mistake if you correct the settings. But **Never** use the small FS with the settings and for an exam that required the large focal spot. This will eventually burn out your filament.<br>

<b>pintastico:</b> This man came for work-up prior to donating a kidney. He was fit and healthy, had the CT and went home. The CT, reported the next day, showed a large para-aortic nodal mass, entirely unexpected, and was thought to be lymphoma or possibly nodal metastases. He was re-called for a physical examination under the oncologists, and nothing was found. The physician did not examine the testicles (face palm). Blood work was sent off, and was negative for lymphoma. He came back to clinic a few days later and was finally asked about testicular symptoms and had an examination. The left testicle was firm and slightly enlarged but painless and symptom free. I did an ultrasound that afternoon and found a large intra-testicular tumour.

In retrospect this was a pTxN3M0 testicular cancer found completely incidentally, with work-up delayed as he was asymptomatic. He'll have an orchidectomy and chemorad and should be fine.

Moral of the story: Check your balls gents! And learn your nodal groups!
<br><br>

<b>KoopaKrab:</b> Woah. I'm just an MS-1 right now, but we had our oncology lecture in anatomy yesterday, and specifically talked about patterns of metastatis from gonads and surrounding tissues. I still find it difficult to believe that testicular cancer will metastasize to the para-aortics, but scrotal cancer will metastasize to the inguinals.

Edit: My knowledge of radiology is obviously very minimal, could you explain to me what exactly we are seeing in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th slides???<br>

<b>pintastico:</b> On call case from this weekend: 18 year old girl with a second presentation in a week of right flank and groin pain. She was treated initially as a complicated UTI, but re-presented with an increase in right sided abdominal pain. The team requested a renal ultrasound to look for pyelonephritis.

Image 1 is a transabdominal US of the pelvis. There is a large right ovarian cystic lesion (measured) posterior to the bladder.

After consent a Transvaginal US was performed.

Image 2 demonstrates the complexity of the cyst with multiple locules, some of differing echogenicity. A rim of ovarian tissue is seen stretched around the medial wall.

Images 3 and 4 show no colour Doppler flow within the cystic lesion or the surrounding ovarian tissue. Image 3 also shows anechoic free fluid in the pouch of Douglas.

The uterus and left ovary (not shown) were normal.

She had laparoscopy and right oophorectomy as the ovary was seen to be torted with a large haemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst, which was presumably the cause of the torsion.<br><br>

<b>MacroDacro:</b> A 19 year old male presents to DEM, post motorbike vs car, obvious midshaft femur fracture. Mobile Chest and Pelvis Xrays performed in DEM, before further femur and tibia xrays done. 
Later in theatre, the Orthopod had trouble reducing the femur fracture, further investigation revealed a neck of femur fracture missed by radiographer (myself), emergency docs, radiologist and orthopod....
Actually quite visible on the original pelvis film. if only we'd done a lateral.<br><br>

<b>pintastico:</b> This man came for work-up prior to donating a kidney. He was fit and healthy, had the CT and went home. The CT, reported the next day, showed a large para-aortic nodal mass, entirely unexpected, and was thought to be lymphoma or possibly nodal metastases. He was re-called for a physical examination under the oncologists, and nothing was found. The physician did not examine the testicles (face palm). Blood work was sent off, and was negative for lymphoma. He came back to clinic a few days later and was finally asked about testicular symptoms and had an examination. The left testicle was firm and slightly enlarged but painless and symptom free. I did an ultrasound that afternoon and found a large intra-testicular tumour.

In retrospect this was a pTxN3M0 testicular cancer found completely incidentally, with work-up delayed as he was asymptomatic. He'll have an orchidectomy and chemorad and should be fine.

Moral of the story: Check your balls gents! And learn your nodal groups!
<br><br>

<b>KoopaKrab:</b> Woah. I'm just an MS-1 right now, but we had our oncology lecture in anatomy yesterday, and specifically talked about patterns of metastatis from gonads and surrounding tissues. I still find it difficult to believe that testicular cancer will metastasize to the para-aortics, but scrotal cancer will metastasize to the inguinals.

Edit: My knowledge of radiology is obviously very minimal, could you explain to me what exactly we are seeing in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th slides???<br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> Some further history would be helpful. For example:
Do you have localized pain? (as in the inside/outiside of your knee), pain with motion?

 Any prior injuries or pain to the other leg? 

Opinions from doctor's visits you might have already inquired.<br><br>

<b>homo-insurgo:</b> I guess the pain's localized in the inside. (When I flex the knee I can hear a grinding sound.) Squatting, getting up, for example, makes the pain worse, as I have some instability in this knee.

No injuries and other leg is fine.

The doctor said that it's related to the patella, but didn't put a firm diagnosis as he wanted to see an MRI first.

Also, apologies for the low resolution images, that's what they gave me.

I keep getting destroyed in my grades despite feeling I have a handle on the subject.  If anyone has anything in mind I will love you forever.<br><br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> What sort of problems are you having with the material? Is it just difficult terminology? or grasping the concepts themselves?

Personally, I was taught imaging physics through [this](http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Imaging-Physics-Radiobiology-Technologist/dp/0398069875/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352169243&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780398069872) excellent book when I was in school. I found it so helpful that I refused to sell it back and kept it to myself. Thanks to that book I can draw and describe the electrical system of an x-ray circuit down to the step up/down transformers and resistors.<br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> Yeah, ouch. 


32 y/o male with a recent surgery for patellar ligament repair. Has undergone recent trauma post-op. Presents to E.R. with 10/10 pain to his post surgical knee.


MR reveals complete transection of the patellar ligament with distraction of the ends, approximately 1 cm and questionable mild superior distraction of the patella.  The patella appears to be grossly intact, however, there appears to be artifact from tendon anchors.  There is joint fluid extending through the defect, all the way to the level of the prepatellar bursa.

<b>MissBrendaSue:</b> Early this morning I was gathering my things for school, when I walked over to my computer where I had noticed that my iPod earbuds were plugged in and chewed on. The left ear section, I guess you would call it, was bitten off and missing indefinitely. After franticly searching my house we were only able to find the volume button and the actual ear bud piece. Suspecting that he ate the remaining pieces, we made him eat some laxatone (a veterinary product containing petrolatum and mineral oil) to ease the passing. He would go into work with my boyfriend (a vet. nurse) and get an abdominal rad., and lone behold! My headphones, in my cats rectum. We narrowly escaped an abdominal surgery and costly bill...

<b>kbrain2:</b> CT ordered last Nov, MRI (w/contrast) in March 2012 and July 2012. Scheduled for MRI in December 2012/January 2013. **Radiologist in Nov 2011 mentioned "cisterna magna variant" in his report for the CT. Radiologist in March described as a "posterior fossa arachnoid cyst." Radiologist in July didn't mention it.**

My understanding is it's not a huge deal either way -- just a small developmental abnormality. But, given my history (below) I find myself curious about whether the malformation discovered with CT/MRI could be related to my other medical issues? :

1. Neuro-developmental issues (diagnosed high-functioning autism, but later changed to auditory processing disorder and ADHD)
2. Cardiac issues (POTS is most recent diagnosis, PFO diagnosed incidentally a few years ago), 
3. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
4. Connective tissue abnormalities (Ehlers Danlos - hypermobility type) 

I've asked many of the neurologists I've seen about it, but they all seem disinterested and just reassure me that it's nothing. Which I understand completely. **But, I don't really understand what would cause it to be diagnosed as mega cisterna magna vs. arachnoid cyst, and if there's any potential ramifications of one diagnosis vs. the other?** I'd be very interested in and grateful for any clarification or redirections to resources where I could learn more about this, if possible. Thanks in advance!<br><br>

Diagnosed with secondary CNS lymphoma.  However, I cannot find any CNS lymphoma so close to the meninges in examples online, and I am not a doctor of any sort.  I'd be greatful for any opinions.

<b>AutonomousPerception:</b> Hi r/radiology. I was hoping someone could give me their opinion on my followup MRI for an L5-S1 microdisectomy. (Imgur only let's me upload 150 images at a time, so [here's](http://imgur.com/a/CrML4) the other 16 in a separate album.)

Here's some background information.
This summer, I started experiencing pain down the outer side of right leg. I got my first MRI on August 20th, 2012. It showed a herniation at L5-S1. I attempted two steroid injections, neither of which helped for longer than a week. On October 15th, 2012, I had a microdisectomy at L5-S1 to remove the herniation. I started physical therapy about two weeks after surgery (October 30th I think). I was slowly progressing, but then started experiencing some back pain throughout early November. Around November 25th, my physical therapist and I determined that I was walking too stiff, so I "loosened up" the way I was walking. Almost immediately, the back pain ceased. On November 28th, I was doing [this stretch](http://health.kerals.com/beauty/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/yoga-stretch.jpg) when I experienced an intense shooting pain down my right leg that caused a lot of the muscles to start spasming. A few days later (almost 2 months after surgery), the nerve pain seemed to return. The nerve pain has now been bothering me for about 2.5 weeks and it doesn't seem to be improving too much. 

Based off of my MRI's, does it look like I may have re-herniated the disc? Let me know if you need any more information and I'll be glad to supply it.<br><br>

Brief neuropsychological testing revealed poor verbal recall - comprehensive assessment will be undertaken in January 2013.

Radiologist report has not been completed but *cerebello-cortical diaschisis* has been suggested.

Will upload my MRI shortly, it's pretty nice..... by a good tech while I managed to stay very still. Also have some nice Axial MRI-PET fusions if anyone is interested (unfortunately, only paper copies I will need to scan).

I'd love to know what you guys think about this "Abnormal" PET?<br><br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> So, last week was pretty interesting to say the least. I'll try to keep it short:

Patient was taken to MR suite for a routine exam; I believe it was an MR Brain. The patient required anesthesia to undergo the procedure. All required (MR Safe) equipment and staff was placed in the MR suite, and preparations began for the procedure. The patient's nurse then decides she needs an additional flat surface for placing instrumentation and monitoring equipment. She proceeds to introduce a non MR safe tray table into the room. Needless to say, the table came too close to the bore, and then went airborne. At this point the patient was already under anesthesia, and had a table hurdling at his head with tremendous force. The MR tech reacted pretty quickly, and tried to divert the table's path. He was successful, at the expense of his own safety. His hand was pinned between the magnet and the table (specifically, crushing his ring finger). He quickly yelled for the anesthesiologist to press the "quench" button. The magnet began its quenching, and the table finally fell, releasing his hand. He was taken to the E.D. for immediate treatment.

Imgur is not letting me label my pictures at this time, so here are the descriptions (in order):

- The "crime scene."
- Temporary cover for MR exhaust.
- Helium system Monitor.
- Heater control panel.
- Point of Impact, yes that is human tissue. (Followed by close-up)
- Imaging post incident (Followed by Lateral view)
- The "culprit." (Followed by close-up)
- Helium containers. (the next day)

**Rad report on the radiographs:**
There is a comminuted fracture of the distal phalanx of the 4th finger. This involves the tuft and shaft to the level of the mid shaft. There is some lateral separation of fracture fragments as well as mild anterior angulation. There is associated soft tissue injury.<br><br>

<b>Wrangler89:</b> Kinda a jumble there.....

All facilities should have a radiation safety officer, someone assigned to oversee radiation safety. That is who you should have talked to. 

ALARA is a principle that you should uphold, you don't violate it by not wearing a dosimeter. You violate it by using techniques that over expose patients.

Not much you can do now that you are no longer employed. You can report them to the States health department, there should be a radiation safety division. Since you no longer work there your no longer obligated to report them. You will not get in trouble with your license. Although they should provide employees with dosimeters.<br><br>

Other things I'd wonder about is something like a hemangiopericytoma (but these would more typically be intracranial with possible extracranial extension whereas this really looks like it started within the skull or even extracranially). The most common large scalp masses with underlying skull destruction that I see are squamous cell carcinomas of the scalp. However, this mass enhances more intensely and homogenously than these usually do. Plus.....HUGE. <br><br>

<b>tehaleks:</b> This may not be new news to any of you, but I stumbled upon it this evening while writing a paper to get INTO the program (if I'm accepted, I'll start this summer, but won't graduate until summer of 2015 or later).

I'm currently in a program at a community college (they are accredited - many students here move on to get a job at the local hospitals and clinics) but I have not completed any previous degrees. As in, this is my first time in college and I chose this program to go directly into this specific field.

I'm not sure what this means. Does this mean I will no longer qualify since I will be graduating AFTER the assigned date? I don't understand.

Please someone tell me before I possibly waste the next 2-3 years of my life. I'm going to go email my program director now, as well.<br><br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> I'm confused about a specific part of your info, maybe you can clear this up: You stated that you are applying to a program that will hopefully start this summer. However, you also mention you are currently in another program that takes you directly into the field. What are the differences between the two? Accreditation? Is your current program a hospital or facility based program?

Many RT programs in the U.S offer at least an associate's degree upon graduation. I believe I have an answer for you, I just need to clear up that info first.<br>

<b>trpchannelsrock:</b> Sorry about the confusion earlier -- have reposted subset of the images.


History / Symptoms

23 year old female diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri after restarting minocycline (09/2011). Headaches improved after discontinuing medication, but other symptoms persisted. Complaints of: gaze-evoked blepharospasm (right-side only, w/ occasional nystagmus), "dizziness", tinnitus, increase in hr + bp (110/60, 60-70 bpm --&gt; 130/80, 100-130 bpm)


Symptoms worsened in 05/2012 with onset of several new complaints (right-sided facial numbness for ~3 weeks), double vision, issues with fatigue, short-term memory, attention. 



Previous Radiological Tests

MRI (03/2012): Several punctuate, periventricular white matter hyperintensities noted on T2 FLAIR, but no lesions that enhance with gadlonium contrast. Posterior fossa arachnoid cyst (most likely incidental).

MRI (07/2012): Bilateral posterior predominant and periventricular white matter T2 prolongation, (also present on the 3/2012 examination, but slightly more conspicuous on 07/2012 exam). No anatomic abnormality related to either third cranial nerve is seen. No enhancement to suggest active inflammation.

MRA (07/2012): Normal intracranial arterial circulation.

MRI: Conducted 02/02/2013. 
<br><br>

<b>trpchannelsrock:</b> Additional Diagnostic Test Results

EKG (01/2012): Normal cardiac rhythm w/ 99 bpm average hr.

Lyme (03/2012): Negative.

Holter Monitor (03/2012): Sinus tachycardia.

Echocardiogram (06/2012): Minor (trace) amounts of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

Lumbar puncture (06/2012): No oligoclonal bands noted. Normal exam with no evidence to support MS diagnosis (or other auto-immune disorder).

VEP (06/2012): WNL.

Ceruloplasmin, Copper (07/2012): WNL.

Sedimentation Rate (07/2012): WNL.

ACE (07/2012): WNL.

T3, T4, TSH (07/2012): WNL.

<b>shadowa4:</b> The move to medical imaging wont bring a dramatic change in pay. If this is one of your biggest motivators, I would suggest you look up the average pay scale for radiologic technologist in your state. However, as a career choice it will offer a wider range of options to specialize and potentially move up the ladder. Like others mentioned, this does take time and depends on job availability in the area. If you are really giving this some thought I would suggest getting to know your local programs a little better. Often the program directors or students nearby can give you great insight regarding career options and availability in the area. If you aren't acquainted with the field, I would even suggest trying to shadow/volunteer with a local healthcare provider to get a better idea of the field. Ive seen too many people enter the programs just to drop out a semester later, all because they "didn't like it."

<b>shadowa4:</b> Text-only posts are not an option in /r/radiology to insure we keep it filled with field related content. When someone has a question (like in this case) you need to provide a link to something related, preferably an imaging case or related website.

Also, you should look into which type of career you are inquiring about. Radiologist and Radiographer are not the same thing, by far. Did you look over the wiki?? There are plenty of discussions there on the matter unless you are looking for something specific.<br><br>

<b>so_ill225:</b> I live in Southern Illinois near Carbondale.  There are 4 schools within a 75 mile radius that pump out about 30-40 RT's every year. I am interested in PA school and I wanted to get healthcare experience, which is why I went to X-ray school.  I know have only been out of school for a year, it is just very frustrating that it is so difficult to find employment, even at a PRN level  <br><br>

<b>comptonscatter:</b> I am in central IL and I think a lot more techs get pumped out a year in this area than that. Not to mention the Chicagoland area. The short answer is the job market is bleak everywhere, sadly. I have been out of school for only 2 years but was one of the lucky ones to have a job offer prior to graduation.<br>

<b>RootimusPrime:</b> Hey everybody. So I've been a long time lurker here for a couple of months now but I wanted to see if I could get some general thoughts or opinions from anybody with insight on this matter.

I am an enlisted member of the US Air Force and my contracted job is a "Diagnostic Imaging" tech. During my three years in the military , I have worked at several military clinics and hospitals and am now nearing the date where I will have to decide whether to reenlist or not. I absolutely love my job where I currently work primarily as a CT tech but occasionally will help out with x-ray when they are short-staffed. I have both my radiography and CT registries. I've been offered the opportunity to be "cross-trained" as a PACS admin because of the DoD civilian layoffs that are going to be happening in the near future. I'm excited about the opportunity to learn PACS because it is another modality that I will have in my repertoire.

My question for the civilian x-ray/CT techs or PACS admins out there:

What is the job climate like for these positions in your area? I work with several civilians at my current facility and all of them agree that there are far too many Rad tech schools, pumping out far too many students every year and it's getting harder and harder to find a job. I haven't had the opportunity to ask any of our PACS techs about their pre-DoD work experiences so I was curious to see if PACS admins were facing the same job shortage crisis as other radiology related tech positions. Any insight that anyone has and is willing to share is greatly appreciate!<br><br>

<b>yermahm:</b> The radiographs look "broken" after the fracture has begun healing. In simplest terms, fractures initially fill in with blood clot. That clot transitions to cartilage. The cartilage slowly calcifies or ossifies. A proximal phalanx fracture like yours is generally healed at 4 weeks, sometimes as long as six. Does it hurt when you move it? Yes?-not healed. No?- healed.<br><br>

<b>shiftace:</b> Thanks!

I can move it but can't bend it fully closed, just somewhat. I just don't want to go back to playing ball too soon and re-break or re-injure it.<br>

<b>Iatros:</b> This is a big load of bullshit. One thing that's really important to remember about medical bills is that they are artificially inflated thanks to the reimbursement schedule of the government. Private insurers use medicare/caid rates as a rule of thumb when negotiating their own payment structures with providers. The first thing to note is that Medicare/Medicaid pay $.20 on the dollar, or less (a private insurer might pay $0.35 or so - just marginally better than the government). So if my "true" cost of reading a study is $100 (paying my office overhead, paying my staff, and paying myself), I have to bill for $500 to actually cover my costs. Then, let's say someone comes in doesn't have insurance and I want to cut them a break. Instead of $500, I bill them for $50 because that's all they can pay. Everyone wins, right?

Wrong. The government auditors catch wind of my different cost schemes, and then come in and insist that I charge everyone covered by Medicare/Medicaid the $50 rate. Oh and by the way, they audit me and say that I overbilled on everything before that, and then force me to pay them back the difference plus interest or I go to jail. So even if hospitals and providers wanted to cut a break to the poor, the government really doesn't let them. They'd get audited so fast their head would spin, and they'd be bankrupted immediately.<br><br>

I went 1st time and even as a radiology student it was great. Some of the topics were maybe hard to understand for a junior (especially the single Scientific Session i went to), but both Rising Stars and Refreshing Courses were well prepared and easy to follow. Diagnostic Pitfalls were especially funny, as even the oldest doctors couldn't get the tricky diagnosis right.

For 5 days Vienna was crawling with radiologist. You could see the bags and badges all over the city, trains, museum, palaces, even at night. Met some cool people.<br><br>

<b>shadowa4:</b> I was actually interested in this career path during the earlier part of last year. However there isn’t much demand for this type of radiology professional in my area (South TX). We have an RPA in one of our larger campuses here, and sure enough he performs multiple procedures alongside radiologists, and overall eases the day’s workload on then rads. I think it’s an interesting career path, and something I would definitely consider for someone interested in the clinical aspects of radiology and procedures.

Regarding your submitted article: I was under the impression that PAs in radiology were certified and accredited by a different governing body than traditional PAs. The [CBRPA]( http://www.cbrpa.org/) , seems to be the governing body overseeing accreditation and education requirements for RPAs in the U.S, but I could be wrong.

<b>Iatros:</b> Oh boy more doom and gloom! Give me a break, radiology may change to more shift work and have more teleradiology, but it's not going away, ever. The idea that rads will be obsolete/outsourced is a popular opinion held by people who don't understand:

1. How medical licensure, hospital credentialing, and malpractice liability work
1. That radiologists do things besides sit in front of a computer and look at pictures, making it hard to practically outsource things like ultrasound, women's imaging, nuclear medicine, GI imaging, and anything with an interventional component in addition to the enormous amount of formal (conference) and informal (telephone or face-to-face) clinical consultation done by a hospital radiologist
1. That the actual cost of the radiologist's interpretation is a small slice (~10%) of the imaging expense pie
1. The worldwide shortage of advanced imaging, and by corollary the lack of training for large numbers of cheap foreign radiologists to read advanced imaging
1. That physicians don't like dealing with radiologists in India or wherever any more than you like calling up IT for your laptop and reaching a foreign call center

<b>Fujhuis:</b> The best way to see a microadenoma is to acquire thin section coronal dynamic contrast enhanced images through the pituitary. Hard to make the diagnosis without them. The high signal on the sagittal T1 is the normal posterior pituitary "bright spot".  
That said, there is no large pituitary mass, or macroadenoma. Can't see a reason for papilledema.  The FLAIR images show something in the right temporal lobe near the hippocampal formation, which to me looks like it could be a cavernous malformation or AVM.  Of course would need to correlate on all three planes and all sequences to make that diagnosis. Do you have any other images?

<b>ducttapetricorn:</b> Here's the information that I know so far.

Image 1 (Chest X-ray): We're supposed to see some sort of perihilar reticulonodular opacities. I did some googling and can't quite figure out where they are on the films or what they mean, so I was hoping perhaps someone can point them out and explain them.

Image 2 (chest and abdomen CT): apparently there are more nodules and enhancing lymph node conglomerates. Again, I can't tell which ones are the "conglomerates" and which ones are just normal bones/tissues.

If anyone has any sort of beginner's source for radiology interpretation, that would be very helpful! :)

~~Currently my friends and I (M1's) guess it's some sort of histiocytosis? We could be completely wrong and aside from that we have no idea what's going on. :\~~

EDIT: Upon further discussion with some classmates we now think it's more likely to be Hodgekin's lymphoma, but still not 100% certain.<br><br>

<b>pintastico:</b> The descriptions above are correct. 
There is bilateral hilar adenopathy, more pronounced on the right.
There are also bilateral supraclavicular nodes and subcarinal nodes.

Without being able to see the other slices I think lymphoma is definitely in the differential diagnosis, along with primary bronchogenic carcinoma, sarcoidosis, and of course metastatic disease of unknown primary.

As always a clinical history helps, as well as blood tests.<br>

<b>Breyskja:</b> This is my pre-op cxr showing my 16 micro dermal corset on my back and the 2 between my breasts. All of these piercings are over a year old. The dr did not make me remove any of them even though I was having work done on my heart and there were a couple in the way when they used fluoro. 
I also have the lat view.

<b>DrOcho:</b> That's an unfortunate turn of events. <br><br>

<b>JDubEww:</b> Yeah. Stressful for mum when she's consented for en bloc resection of uterus if it looks necessary in theatre (other slides it looks right on uterus but weren't sure if it invaded). Stressful case for quite a few teams involved in her care.

Happy outcome so far. Mother went through surgical resection without needing uterus removed, had a successful full term delivery, and re imaging was all clear 1 year down the track.<br>

<b>Kennard:</b> An interesting region to have a herniated disc. They tend not to rupture in that area without some sort of trauma. 

I would have to agree with emaf37 that an axial image would be most helpful in determining what would be indicated for this image.

His option are anywhere from physical therapy, a microdiscectomy, or a spinal fusion from T11-T12.<br><br>

<b>ShortArmpitHair:</b> Was climbing a wall and felt my wrist let go, docotors reckon i've broken my wrist in the past, i have no recollection of this!

at the moment, my wrist look really out of place, ulna is really poking out! Just awaiting MRI scan's to make sure I havent damaged any nerves.... any chance it will "slide" back in? <br><br>

<b>Dumpstered:</b> Patient (30 year old white male, ~425lbs, previous a VSG patient maxing out at just over 600lbs) complained of a complete lack of sex drive, lowered ambition and inability to gain muscle or burn fat despite calorie restriction due to surgery and a fairly strict exercise regiment. MRI was ordered once two independent Testosterone blood tests came back with levels around 50ng/dl. A cortisol lab was ordered but results have not been received from that as of yet.<br><br>

<b>louminsboomins:</b> The "winged" abnormalities appear to be osteophytes, or bony spurs, at the head of both the first (laterally) and third (medially and laterally). They're normal variants and can be removed surgically if causing pain for long periods of time. Someone else may be able to shed more light, but I hope that helps!<br><br>
